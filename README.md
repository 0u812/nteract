# composition

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nteract/composition.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nteract/composition)

:notebook: Electron app of the Jupyter Notebook

This is a work in progress. Check out the issues for more detail.

### Development

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it `git clone https://github.com/nteract/composition`
3. `cd` to where you `clone`d it
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

Assets are compiled via electron-compile directly, no worry about build steps until we make a release. As you hack on components, you can reload directly or pop open the dev console and run `location.reload()`. No hot reloading at the moment.
