# How do I make a contribution?

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work
in the nteract world? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you
would like to address.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone
https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the
feature that you want to add.
6. Add and commit the changed files using `git add` and `git commit`.
7. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin
branch-name-here`.
8. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
9. Title the pull request with "Problem: issue or feature addressed".
10. Set the description of the pull request with "Solution: fix provided or
feature added".
11. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
